rdtscbench measures operations in clock cycles using RDTSC x86 instruction

rdtscbench is free software licensed under the GPL v2.

IMPORTANT: Before running make and rdtscbench disable CPU dynamic clock.
	On Linux: # service cpuspeed stop

IMPORTANT 2: If the computer hybernates during the measurement, it may 
	break the measurement.

The Makefile runs gethz.sh to cat /proc/cpuinfo looking for the CPU speed.
	The result is saved in hzdef.h. See example:
	$ cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep MHz
	cpu MHz		: 2701.000
	gethz.sh converts 2701.000 to 2701000000LL and saves it at hzdef.h
