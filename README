rdtscbench measures small and large operations using clock cycles as 
time measurement unit. It uses RDTSC x86 instruction to get clock 
cycles from CPU registers

rdtscbench is free software licensed under the GPL v2.

IMPORTANT: Before running make and rdtscbench disable CPU dynamic clock.
	On Linux: # service cpuspeed stop

IMPORTANT 2: If the computer hybernates during the measurement, it may 
	break the measurement.

The Makefile runs gethz.sh to cat /proc/cpuinfo looking for the CPU speed.
	The result is saved in hzdef.h. See example:
	$ cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep MHz
	cpu MHz		: 2701.000
	gethz.sh converts 2701.000 to 2701000000LL and saves it at hzdef.h
